        <h1>FAQ</h1>

        <p> <strong>&#8226;How The Prices Are So Low?</strong> </p>
        <p>All WordPress items such as plugins and themes are licensed under the General Public License (GPL). This means that once we have purchased the item we are free to redistribute it if we choose to do so. Your membership to our site goes towards
            maintaining and buying the subscriptions to 3rd party theme and plugin authors. This form of crowd funding helps keep prices low and we can then pass this benefit on to you.</p>
        <p><strong>&#8226; Are The Plugins Original?</strong></p>
        <p>Yes, all the plugins and themes are obtained securely by downloading directly from the original authors and We just redistribute it without changing the products. </p>

        <p> <strong>&#8226;Why Are These Plugins/Themes Asking Me For A License Key?</strong> </p>
        <p>Ignore it. Developers include these so that the plugin or theme can update automatically or so that you can register for support. The item itself will work perfectly fine without anything being entered in the box. We would recommend updating your
            theme/plugins manually when updates become available on our site.</p>
        <p> <strong>&#8226;Why I See “License Activation” or “Upgrade to Premium” Message In My YITH Plugin ? Is This Free Version ?</strong> </p><br>
        <p>As i said before, Ignore it. These plugin is “PREMIUM” version and you still receive all the premium functionality. License key only for unlock automatic update.
        </p>
        <p><strong>&#8226;Do GPLTHEMEPLUGIN Provide License Keys?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>We cannot and won't provide/lease/release/resell license keys. </strong> All the products offered in this website are licensed under GNU GPL License. You do not need any license keys to use them in as many of your projects you need. This
            plugins and themes only require license keys to get automatic updates from their authors.</p>
        <p> <strong>&#8226;Do GPLTHEMEPLUGIN Provide Support?</strong> </p>
        <p>We provide basic support for installing plugins and themes. If you need any major modification / advanced support, you can purchase from original author or hiring a developer
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8226;We are just providing you files. Please remember that if you want technical support for these files, you can purchase it separately from original developer of these scripts. This will help them financially for further development as well.
